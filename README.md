# map_generator

## Setup Instructions
### Basic Setup
1. Clone this git repo: `git clone https://github.com/liloryan/map_generator`
2. Install [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
3. Create the conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yml` (this must be done in the `map_generator` directory)
4. Install pytorch (see [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). This is not included in the `environment.yml` file because it is platform dependent.
5. Activate the conda environment: `conda activate map_generator`
